I worked on a Flight Fare Prediction project using the Random Forest algorithm to estimate ticket prices based on features like airline,
source, destination, departure time, and duration. I handled data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning to improve accuracy.
Random Forest helped capture complex patterns and reduce overfitting. This project sharpened my skills in regression modeling and data interpretation, 
and I translated the results into actionable insights for pricing strategies and travel platforms.
